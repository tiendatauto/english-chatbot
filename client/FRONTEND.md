# EngAce Frontend Implementation

## Overview
The frontend implementation of EngAce focuses on creating a seamless onboarding experience for new users. Built with Next.js and ShadCN UI components, it features a responsive design and robust form validation.

## Key Features
- First-time user onboarding flow
- Form validation using Zod and React Hook Form
- Secure storage of user preferences in localStorage
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support

## Project Structure
```

│   ├── globals.css          # Global styles
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Root layout with metadata

│   ├── OnboardingForm.tsx  # Main onboarding form component
│   └── ui/                 # Reusable UI components
│       ├── input.tsx
│       └── select.tsx
└── lib/
    └── localStorage.ts     # User preferences management
```

## User Flow
1. First-time users are automatically directed to the onboarding form
2. Users must complete all required fields:
   - Full name
   - Gender selection
   - Age (with validation)
   - Gemini API key
3. Form data is validated before submission
4. On successful completion, users are redirected to the dashboard
5. Preferences are stored in localStorage for future sessions

## Technical Details
- Form validation using Zod schema
- Client-side routing with Next.js
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Development
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Security Considerations
- API keys are stored locally and not transmitted to any external servers
- Form validation ensures data integrity
- Client-side storage using localStorage for user preferences

## Next Steps
1. Implement additional dashboard features
2. Add error boundary components
3. Enhance form accessibility
4. Add loading states and animations
5. Implement proper state management for larger application needs
